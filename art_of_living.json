There are numerous Ecuadorians, Somalis, and Hmong people in the twin cities metro, so expect a higher than usual offering of those cuisines and tangential cuisines (mexican, ethiopian, and viet, respectively). \n10. Minneapolis has a huge number of organic food coops. Visit one of them for all those needs.\n11. Music scene is vibrant but crowds can be a little quiet. Minnesotans tend to enjoy music internally. Again, tons of music venues and theaters - the Guthrie, the Jungle, the Orpheum, etc\n12. Minneapolis has a history of segregation but there is a continuous and visible effort made to close disparities. It has not been fully successful yet. There is vibrant minority communities of all kinds here\n13. Atheists will have more luck in Minneapolis than in the suburbs.

Left 20+ years ago and I don't miss it. Have lived in FL, VA, CA since then. All of my friends and family left too, so the first thing I'm going to say is don't underestimate how transient people are there. Who knows if your friends will stay. New Yorkers are snobby, too - we tend to avoid transplants. YMMV but you may find it hard to make additional friends.\n\nPublic transportation is dirty and unsafe. Actually had a friend in high school who was murdered by being pushed onto the tracks by a crazy person.  The subway system is old and not well maintained. Dirt aside, it's not uncommon to get stuck on a train in the middle of a tunnel, or to be told that the next stop will be the last (even if it's not supposed to be).  It will never be modernized to the extent needed and will never be ADA compliant.\n\nManhattan is its own beast. There are lovely neighborhoods in the outer boroughs (excluding Staten Island because as all true New Yorkers know, that's just a place in New Jersey) that are more affordable BUT then you end up in a two-fare zone. So it's a trade-off. I grew up on a tree-lined street full of single family homes with a few apartment buildings sprinkled in, in the Bronx. I worked in Manhattan most of the time and it was a long, nightmarish commute no matter how I did it.  IMO living in Manhattan or Brooklyn is not worth the prices.\n\nNowhere beats the arts/cultural scene in NYC, TBH. That's why people stick it out. So it depends on what floats your boat. \n\nAs for getting out of the city - you can be in the woods in an hour or so, and there are nice beaches within an hour too. To do this you'd need a car, which if you're in Manhattan or Brooklyn you'll have to rent garage space to park it in, and that's expensive (like renting a second apartment).

All of my friends and family left too, so the first thing I'm going to say is don't underestimate how transient people are there. Who knows if your friends will stay. New Yorkers are snobby, too - we tend to avoid transplants. YMMV but you may find it hard to make additional friends.\n\nPublic transportation is dirty and unsafe. Actually had a friend in high school who was murdered by being pushed onto the tracks by a crazy person.  The subway system is old and not well maintained. Dirt aside, it's not uncommon to get stuck on a train in the middle of a tunnel, or to be told that the next stop will be the last (even if it's not supposed to be).  It will never be modernized to the extent needed and will never be ADA compliant.\n\nManhattan is its own beast. There are lovely neighborhoods in the outer boroughs (excluding Staten Island because as all true New Yorkers know, that's just a place in New Jersey) that are more affordable BUT then you end up in a two-fare zone. So it's a trade-off. I grew up on a tree-lined street full of single family homes with a few apartment buildings sprinkled in, in the Bronx. I worked in Manhattan most of the time and it was a long, nightmarish commute no matter how I did it.  IMO living in Manhattan or Brooklyn is not worth the prices.\n\nNowhere beats the arts/cultural scene in NYC, TBH. That's why people stick it out. So it depends on what floats your boat. \n\nAs for getting out of the city - you can be in the woods in an hour or so, and there are nice beaches within an hour too. To do this you'd need a car, which if you're in Manhattan or Brooklyn you'll have to rent garage space to park it in, and that's expensive (like renting a second apartment). You can be in the Adirondacks in a couple of hours, same for Hudson Valley.\n\nIn the end the grind wasn't worth it to me. It wore me, a native, down. I've been much happier everywhere else I've lived despite whatever challenges the other places have. I only miss one particular pizza place and the bagels, then again I'm celiac now so...", "author": "LeaveDaCannoli", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1740940205.0}, {"body": "Your \"assumptions\" are correct.

The vast majority of housing you’ll be able to afford on an academic salary will be in a walk up and most of the subway is not accessible and is highly unreliable to have a working elevator.

NYC is not the only place where you can be trapped in urban density. The other cons might be true but nowhere is perfect.\n\nBased off your post in general, I’d say NYC isn’t for you.

Left 20+ years ago and I don't miss it. Have lived in FL, VA, CA since then. All of my friends and family left too, so the first thing I'm going to say is don't underestimate how transient people are there. Who knows if your friends will stay. New Yorkers are snobby, too - we tend to avoid transplants. YMMV but you may find it hard to make additional friends.\n\nPublic transportation is dirty and unsafe. Actually had a friend in high school who was murdered by being pushed onto the tracks by a crazy person.  The subway system is old and not well maintained. Dirt aside, it's not uncommon to get stuck on a train in the middle of a tunnel, or to be told that the next stop will be the last (even if it's not supposed to be).  It will never be modernized to the extent needed and will never be ADA compliant.\n\nManhattan is its own beast. There are lovely neighborhoods in the outer boroughs (excluding Staten Island because as all true New Yorkers know, that's just a place in New Jersey) that are more affordable BUT then you end up in a two-fare zone. So it's a trade-off. I grew up on a tree-lined street full of single family homes with a few apartment buildings sprinkled in, in the Bronx. I worked in Manhattan most of the time and it was a long, nightmarish commute no matter how I did it.  IMO living in Manhattan or Brooklyn is not worth the prices.\n\nNowhere beats the arts/cultural scene in NYC, TBH. That's why people stick it out. So it depends on what floats your boat. \n\nAs for getting out of the city - you can be in the woods in an hour or so, and there are nice beaches within an hour too. To do this you'd need a car, which if you're in Manhattan or Brooklyn you'll have to rent garage space to park it in, and that's expensive (like renting a second apartment). You can be in the Adirondacks in a couple of hours, same for Hudson Valley.\n\nIn the end the grind wasn't worth it to me. It wore me, a native, down.
