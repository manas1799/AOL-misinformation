Will he be able to always pay all of the condo (+HOA)? In USA, is it possible to be co-owner with him, without being BOTH liable for the mortgage? Because let's say you both sign the deed, then both sign the mortgage loan (what most vanilla couples do) even though he says he will pay it all, most mortgage loans stipulate that both co-owners are severally and jointly responsible for paying back the loan and grant a lien on the house. This means he could stop paying tomorrow and you'll have to pay for both. I am unsure I would accept that early to sign the deed AND the mortgage. Also, if you sign the deed, make sure you have at least 50% coownership instead of 25%, by example (especially if you're liable for 50% of the mortgage). I'd ask for a copy of the contracts before signing and I would consult a lawyer to revise them and make up my mind. Your sd doesn't need to know, and if he refuses you to ask for a copy to think about it, it's a Redflag. If you don't have the means to pay a lawyer to help you think through this, you probably should not sign.
