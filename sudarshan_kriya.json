Usually it is your soul, through your spirit, bringing in the pure energy of the Creator, according to your conscious or unconscious will. But who/how is the Creator?\n\nTo talk to your theory: Kerry K (find her on YouTube) says that attachments take up spaces inside us that we cannot fill, for a while we experience life under their influence, and they leave when we have learnt to overcome them or fill those voids ourselves. That said, we are probably talking “negative” or so called dark entities and experiences here, and I am mindful of how those who are obsessed with the masculine “light father” approach to personal growth ignore and deny the Mother at their peril. These creatures are really just hungry, maybe they have a job to do. So instead of expanding the chakras out, I am exploring what happens when we pull them in all the way, including whatever is bothering us, and offer it back to the unknown or the void or the Mother.

The lineage. The guru should belong to a recognised lineage (sampradaya) and be part of an authentic transmission (parampara). This can easily be done by “googling” the guru or simply by asking him (or her) what their lineage is or who their guru was. This question is a culturally valid question and one should not feel shy about doing so.\n2. The level of knowledge of the guru. This is difficult because to ascertain the level of knowledge one needs to have some grounding in the Dharma. Generally one should check if the guru encourages questions or not and if questions are answered satisfactorily.\n3. The ability to teach and transmit. A guru may have the knowledge and all the qualifications but be unable to teach effectively. The purpose of the guru-disciple relationship is to instruct, educate and transform the disciple (shishya) if the guru is technically unable to do this then there is no point to the relationship.\n4. If the teacher “embodies” the teachings. The guru must be an exemplar of the Dharma and must embody the teachings and be a good role-model. They should be teaching by example — this is the meaning of the term acharya.\n5. The effect on disciples and followers. One should observe the behaviour and inter-personal dynamic of the disciples and followers and note if they are in concord with the Dharma teachings delivered by the guru. Likewise the disciple is also tested by the guru to ascertain whether he/she is a fit person to receive the transmission.\n\n[https://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/all\\_about\\_gurus.pdf](https://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/all_about_gurus.pdf)", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1738343566.0}, {"body": "Rajiv Malhotra has spoken about this topic and has openly stated that 3 followers who learnt spirituality and meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, namely Deepak Chopra, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Rishi Prabhakar broke the Guru Parampara\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN3ILv3goHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN3ILv3goHk)", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1740386280.0}, {"body": "Why is it that Sri Sri has not seem to mention who his Guru is in any book or video ?", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1738215413.0}, {"body": "He also indirectly claimed being attributed as a reincarnation of Jesus.\n\nThen he went on to say how Jesus or Krishna is just one of the several memories and he doesn't want to be limited by it.\n\nWhat does that mean ?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/racmd77h1sge1.jpeg?width=1260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4075259e1cedd6b007a68b230703adf793daeb1f", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1738524351.0}, {"body": "Spirituality is bullshit.

The lineage. The guru should belong to a recognised lineage (sampradaya) and be part of an authentic transmission (parampara). This can easily be done by “googling” the guru or simply by asking him (or her) what their lineage is or who their guru was. This question is a culturally valid question and one should not feel shy about doing so.\n2. The level of knowledge of the guru. This is difficult because to ascertain the level of knowledge one needs to have some grounding in the Dharma. Generally one should check if the guru encourages questions or not and if questions are answered satisfactorily.\n3. The ability to teach and transmit. A guru may have the knowledge and all the qualifications but be unable to teach effectively. The purpose of the guru-disciple relationship is to instruct, educate and transform the disciple (shishya) if the guru is technically unable to do this then there is no point to the relationship.\n4. If the teacher “embodies” the teachings. The guru must be an exemplar of the Dharma and must embody the teachings and be a good role-model. They should be teaching by example — this is the meaning of the term acharya.\n5. The effect on disciples and followers. One should observe the behaviour and inter-personal dynamic of the disciples and followers and note if they are in concord with the Dharma teachings delivered by the guru. Likewise the disciple is also tested by the guru to ascertain whether he/she is a fit person to receive the transmission.\n\n[https://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/all\\_about\\_gurus.pdf](https://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/all_about_gurus.pdf)", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1738343566.0}, {"body": "Rajiv Malhotra has spoken about this topic and has openly stated that 3 followers who learnt spirituality and meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, namely Deepak Chopra, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Rishi Prabhakar broke the Guru Parampara\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN3ILv3goHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN3ILv3goHk)", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1740386280.0}, {"body": "Why is it that Sri Sri has not seem to mention who his Guru is in any book or video ?", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1738215413.0}, {"body": "He also indirectly claimed being attributed as a reincarnation of Jesus.\n\nThen he went on to say how Jesus or Krishna is just one of the several memories and he doesn't want to be limited by it.\n\nWhat does that mean ?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/racmd77h1sge1.jpeg?width=1260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4075259e1cedd6b007a68b230703adf793daeb1f", "author": "Relative_Worker4117", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1738524351.0}, {"body": "Spirituality is bullshit.

As the teacher guided us through the rhythmic breathing patterns, something incredible happened. It felt like my entire system hit a reset button. All the stress, anixiety, and mental clutter I didn’t even realize I was carrying just dissolved. By the end of the session, I felt an indescribable sense of calm and clarity, like I had been reintroduced to myself.\n\nThe Art of Living teacher who conducted workshop was funny, relatable, and made the entire experience enjoyable—even for someone skeptical like me. The session didn’t feel overly serious or preachy.\n\nAfterward, I learned that Art of Living Foundation, offers free weekly follow-up sessions in most cities across 100 plus countrirs where anyone can practice and stay consistent. \n\nThat moment sparked a journey I couldn’t have foreseen. It’s been 24 years since that day, and I’ve been practicing Sudarshan Kriya every single day. Over time, this simple yet powerful practice has helped me navigate challenges with resilience, deepen my emotional strength, and cultivate a sense of inner peace I didn’t think was possible. I find myself grounded in the present moment and moving forward with clarity and confidence.\n\nThe beauty of Sudarshan Kriya is in its simplicity. It doesn’t require any special equipment, just your breath!\n\nThis isn’t just my story.

It is important to be faithful to that set up in order to replicate some results. It would be ingenuous to look up medicines for cancer on google for example and try to medicate oneself. So there are certain things which need to be done in certain way. There are hundreds of meditations and talks on Art of Living available online for free.
