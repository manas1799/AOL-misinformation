Good habits will help a little, but aren't enough.\n\nHowever, caffeine of any kind is a problem though. If you're drinking any caffeine, you need to stop. Completely.

Instead of giving me any new options, my psych told me to go back to mirtazapine and stay on 7.5mg... It's significantly less sedating than trazodone. There's not really anywhere to go in terms of dosage changes with mirtazapine if 7.5 doesn't work. I think alternating might be a good idea, since day 1 of mirtazapine hits so much harder than day 2.
