I think I cut a few in half (which is hard because they're triangular), so that I could take another half if I needed to throughout the night.  On 25-37 mg the first week I got 7 hours sleep the first night, then 6 hours, then 5 and a half, and then 5 hours... So I was descending in the amount of time I was sleeping with just using 25-37mg Quiviviq . After those first few days, I called my doctor and said it's not working, so she prescribed Lunesta. Took that for a few days and could not really take anything else with it because I had a colonoscopy coming up. On Lunesta it was about the same as Quiviviq... 5 to 6.5 hours of sleep each night.  After my colonoscopy, I was able to add back in my OTC vitamins and minerals that I take before I go to bed (l-theanine, zinc, magnesium glycinate and GABA), Ramelteon and/or the occasional over-the-counter antihistamine if I wake up in the middle of the night and I can't go back to sleep.  While still using Lunesta, I did some more research on Quiviviq (because I really wanted it to work considering the low risk of dependency and tolerance) and learned Quiviviq can take up to two or three weeks to really start taking effect. So... I went back to the Quiviviq but upped it to two 25 mg pills (50mg )instead of one or one and a half. I had much better results when I stuck with it at that dosage,  but I still wake up after 5 hours and have to take something to go back to sleep usually it's a half of a unisom or half of a Benadryl. So all in all it's not perfect, but I'm getting between 6 to 8 hours of sleep every night alternating between Lunesta and Quiviviq.\n\nEdit: Ramelteon is prescription but is considered one of the safest and most prescribed sleeping pills.

A few years ago, my dad switched to a new job that was a 4 hour drive away from our family home. Due to this long drive, he lives in the city he works in and visits my mom (55F) on weekends. Since he started this new job, he has a manager who deliberately picks on him (doing peer reviews only for him, excluding him from team meetings, yelling at him in front of the whole office, getting mad that he used a yellow highlighter and not a red one. Just to name a few) and this workplace bullying is definitely getting to him and is effecting his physical health (insomnia, higher blood pressure, etc.). Although he has been at this position for about 3 years and has been complaining about his bad manager, neither my mom nor I really took it seriously because he is known to quit jobs just because he did not like a co-worker or colleague (He moved across the country to try and find a better workplace, but people are the same everywhere. In his attempt to move, he also tried to move our family with him). We just assumed he was just being his difficult self (he has minimal emotional intelligence and most people do not like interacting with him) and did not question it, but he has only told us recently about these occurrences. \n\nBecause this is effecting his physical health, he has decided that he wants to be diagnosed with anxiety or workplace related PTSD, but does not want to pursue therapy. I told him that I think there is no point in just being diagnosed without undergoing some treatment or therapy as it might help him navigate his interpersonal relationships. This is when he suggested seeing my therapist. Although I have been out of therapy for a while, I do not feel comfortable with him seeing the same therapist that I did, especially considering a lot of the things I worked on in therapy had to do with family trauma and cultural pressures (I am Chinese in Canada). \n\nBoth my parents think that because I am \"cured\" because I no longer need therapy, my therapist is the best and my dad should see her. They have been pressuring me to email her and get her to accept my dad as a client, but I do not want to email her. I did express that I do not want my dad to use my therapist and my mom exploded. Saying that because my parents share their family doctor, physiotherapist and chiropractor with me, I should be filial and share my therapist. Insinuating that because I will not email my therapist, I am not a good child, selfish, worthless and am ungrateful for everything.  \n\nThis was earlier today and things had not cooled down at all. My mom has been slamming every door on me, scoffing and just being generally unpleasant to be around and triggering some of my past anxiety and trauma related to family issues. I am more than happy to help my dad find a therapist that he likes and get his diagnosis, but I just don't want to share my therapist. But maybe I am overreacting because I am sure she would respect my privacy as a client but I don't know. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
