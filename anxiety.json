I struggle with anxiety and depression.\n\nTowards the end of 2023 both of my grandparents died, and I don't think I ever fully coped with it. Fast forward to November of 2024, I'm taking college classes and I'm doing great in them, high school is going amazing. When towards the end of the month my cat died, she was my baby, was there for me through everything, and was my first ever pet. I went into a horrible depression and stopped doing all of my work, I failed my one college class and the other two gave me in-completes to try and help.\n\nThe one class I got everything in, she updated my grade. The last class is horrible.. he keeps accusing me of using Al when I'm not. When I ask what makes him think that he says he won't tell me incase he needs to escalate the situation. So I redid the 5 page essay for him, and sent proof that my writing is not ai using an ai detector and it came back 0%. He said this was not proof and is giving me one final chance, I don't even have the textbook he wants me to read so l was online looking for hours for sources but doesn't believe me at all. Everything was due March 1st but he hasn't answered me, I'm so screwed.\n\nI've ruined my chance to walk at graduation and possibly continue to be in this college for my official semester in fall of 2025. It's drove me into a horrible spiral. It's my fault i'm in this position, my mom is so disappointed in me. She might have to pay over 1k because of this.\n\nI've started to consider to take my own life because I can't handle this anymore. My future is ruined, my dreams are crushed, and it's all because of me. I am not here for pity since this is my doing, but I'm lost and ready to take my life if it comes to it. If I can't get out of this mess i've accepted that I have ruined my life and I don't have a future anymore. I'm so disappointed, angry, and disgusted with myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe you can move in with your mum rent free and she can help raise the baby whilst you finish your studying. \n\nI know this answer is all over the place but I just wanted to touch on each of your points and make you aware that whatever decision you decide to make will be the right decision.
