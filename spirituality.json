Don’t ask what we think of your chart, or what is interesting, or anything general or vague or asking to ask. **Do not ask for a general reading, only specific questions.** no one word posts. posting memes or off topic content will result in a ban. If your reddit karma is too low your post may not appear in the subreddit, try raising your karma before making a modmail.\n* G2: Banned topics: nsfw topics, questions about past lives, fame, sexuality, longevity, exam results, gambling, depression, mental illnesses, death or abuse. Do not ask for Synastry(includes divorce) since they are too time consuming and this is not a matrimonial forum. Please be wary of people asking for DMs as many are scams.\n* G3: For drawing charts use the pinned links in the sticky post or sidebar rule 4. Jhora screenshots will be preferred. Do not post tropical charts or western circular charts. Random site charts can have errors, missing information or issues of readability. **All charts should have the planet degree positions displayed on the chart.** Post full charts, not lists of placements.\n* G4: Don't use incorrect terminology such as houses in vargas. e.g - a house in vedic astrology spans 30 degrees in the D1 chart and there are 12 houses, each house in turn contains 9 divisions spanning 3 degrees and 20 mins so we get 12 x 9 = 108 such divisions which are called navamsas. The navamsa chart shows this collection of 108 navamsas and not 12 houses. So statements such as the following are **incorrect** e.g my 7th house in my navamsa chart has venus in it. **A 30 degree portion cannot be inside a 3 degree portion**. Your post will be removed for this.\n* G5: general question about placements or yourself or hypothetical stuff require your chart too. Please don't post charts on behalf of other people like your exes or crushes etc. Don't make posts asking for chart reader recommendations or service reviews.\n* G6: If your post does not meet these conditions, please delete it and repost.

A major element of hoodoo is being able to utilize what you immediately have access to, and connect to the essence of it.  A cup of water next to a small candle upon a book case, or fireplace, or shelf etc can be an altar for example.\n\nAnd really, it's important to understand that you are already a part of your Ancestors and they're a part of you.  You can quite literally meditate or pray directly to them right now in the air around you, and continue to do so day by day.  Altars facilitate spiritual activity between you and them of course, which is why water is utilized, but don't overcomplicate this.  Veneration can honestly begin right now where you are at, and the act of tracing out your lineage is another aspect of that as well.\n\nYour personal altar will evolve naturally as you deepen your practice, so don't really stress out over it now.  Things come slowly and won't happen overnight and your spirits already get this.  Just put together something simple with a cup of water and a candle and start there.

One can meditate whilst talking to God or some significant other in meditation, but imagine how their thoughts would look.

Well, as it turns out you can have extra room when thoughts and feelings work that way where there can be more feelings that can be micromanaged if someone so chooses. They can be so absorbed in the act of communicating that it's as if the processes blend together. thoughts/emotions/ energy merge in their own objective ways and one can learn how to be present with an abundance of things they can have work together while being absorbed in their concentration. They're \"going\".\n\nIt can be very freeing to find a way to be that works very well for you, like being nearly fearless. However it can seem to crumble in front of u sometimes.
